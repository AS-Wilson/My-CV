%%%%% Career Aims %%%%%
\cvsection{Career Aims}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gain more in-depth knowledge in Physics, Electronics, and Software Engineering.
\item Attain a Masters in Physics, Electronics, programming, or similar fields.
\item Obtain an industry or PhD position and gain experience in Physics, Electronic Design, Mechatronics, Signal-Processing, or a related field depending on my obtained masters.
\end{itemize}

 \vspace{2mm}
These career aims are the goals I intend to achieve in the next five years. However, I have a general love of learning, engineering, and research in general and my desire to learn, create, and explore will never cease.
