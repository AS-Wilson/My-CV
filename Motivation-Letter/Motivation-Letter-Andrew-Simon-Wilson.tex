%%%%% INTRO %%%%%
I am an Engineer from Ireland currently studying in the \href{http://www.erasmus-master.emimeo.eu/}{EMIMEO (Erasmus Master on Innovative Microwave Electronics and Optics) Programme}, an \textbf{\href{https://www.eacea.ec.europa.eu/scholarships/erasmus-mundus-catalogue_en}{Erasmus Mundus Masters}} on Microwave Electronics and Photonics.
I would please like to state my interest in applying for \textbf{\color{accent}\MakeUppercase{X position}}. \linebreak


%%%%% INTEREST & EXPERIENCE %%%%%

\textbf{\color{accent}\MakeUppercase{I change the following to highlight any experience or interest depending on the position I am applying for.}}

I have a great interest in, and passion for, the topics of Physics (specifically Quantum Physics), Electronic Design and Theory, Robotics, and Embedded Software. \linebreak 
During the two years that I worked at an ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance) based engineering company called \href{https://www.7techgroup.com/}{Seven Technologies Group}. I worked on different research \& design based projects. This work gave me critical experience in high-speed electronic design (both digital and analogue), embedded software using C, C++, and Linux, application software in the form of Python, constructing test procedures, and Mechanical design along with many other topics. \linebreak


%%%%% SKILLS, QUALITIES, ACADEMICS ETC. %%%%%

I can offer a comprehensive academic background which is suited to \textbf{\color{accent}\MakeUppercase{X position}}, evidenced through the following modules I have studied including \textbf{\color{accent}\MakeUppercase{I highlight modules I have studied that are relevant to position}}.
Additionally, my work positions at Seven Technologies group, freelancing, and at other companies have given me essential technical skills in a number of Engineering and Physics topics. This means that I can excel in the practical application of technologies and engineering with comprehensive academic understanding. \linebreak

My time as chairperson of the Ulster Society of Student Engineers (USSE) has also provided me the opportunity to lead strategic and technical projects honing essential skills in communication, presentation, people managing, and time management to name a few. These non-technical skills have taught me a great deal about how to complete projects and carry out my studies and other extra-curricular activities in an effective and practical way. \linebreak


%%%%% CONCLUSION %%%%%

Along with the mentioned relevant skills and experience I can offer a genuine passion in engineering, innovating, and learning. I have devoted considerable time to applying methods used in education. With my hard work, determination, and dedication your position would allow me to further hone these skills. \linebreak

I sincerely hope that I will be considered for a \textbf{\color{accent}\MakeUppercase{position in company/lab}} and I would like to thank you very much for reading my application. I look forward to hearing from you, or providing any additional information you require. \linebreak


\textbf{Yours faithfully,}\\
